CHIP category derived from soma cnv
===================================

CHIP (clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential) can be viewed in whole genome sequencing (WGS) data as clones having a VAF (variant allele frequency) other than 0.5 or 1.
The [soma-cnv](https://github.com/mpinese) software models this CHIP from WGS data.  
The programs in this repository determine one overall category for the CHIP observed in the soma-cnv modelling output.  

These CHIP categorisation programs were developed for the following cohort studies:
* MGRB [(Medical Genome Reference Bank)](https://sgc.garvan.org.au/initiatives) data
is a whole-genome data resource of 4000 healthy elderly individuals
([manuscript 1](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/473348v1), [manuscript 2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41431-018-0279-z)).
* ISKS [(International Sarcoma Kindred Study)](http://sarcomahelp.org/articles/sarcoma-kindred-study.html) data
is a whole-genome data resource (manuscript in preparation).
